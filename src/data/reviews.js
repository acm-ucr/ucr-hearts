      "Joining HEARTS has been one of the best decisions of my college career! The workshops are super interactive and helpful. I still remember how excited I was to learn how to tie surgical knots at the suturing workshop. Plus, attending health fairs and applying what we’ve learned is incredibly rewarding. It’s not all work, though—the club socials are a blast, and I’ve made some amazing friends here. HEARTS is perfect for anyone curious about healthcare or who wants to get hands-on experience.",

      "HEARTS has been an amazing experience! As someone who wasn’t sure which medical specialty to pursue, the variety of guest speakers has been eye-opening. Hearing firsthand from doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals about their paths and challenges has helped me narrow down my interests. The hands-on workshops, like learning to take vitals and practicing suturing on Totoro stuffies, are so practical and fun—I feel like I’m already preparing for med school! The socials are also a great way to meet like-minded peers. I highly recommend HEARTS to anyone interested in healthcare",
